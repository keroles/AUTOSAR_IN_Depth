\chapter{Using Goil}

Goil is the OIL compiler of Trampoline. It parses application configuration OIL files, verify the coherency of the configuration and generates corresponding source code, header and script files.

Goil parses files compliant with the OIL 3.3 specification and handles some extensions for build system configuration and AUTOSAR configuration\footnote{Starting with AUTOSAR v3, the OIL language has been abandoned in favor of a XML description. However, Goil continues to support an OIL description of AUTOSAR objects because OIL is far easier to read.}.

Goil is available for Mac OS X (version 10.4 or greater), Linux 32 and 64 bits and Windows 32 bits as a command line tool. It is also available for Mac OS X as an application that includes an editor with syntax coloring.
