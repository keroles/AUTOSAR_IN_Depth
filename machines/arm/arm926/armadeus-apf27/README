This port is currently not working with the trunk version of trampoline. Please wait while we are importing previous work with an old version of trampoline.

Roadmap :
- bootstraping      : done
- context switching : done
- interrupt support : done, needs improvements, especially about acknoledge
- memmap support    : done
- memory protection : done
- trusted functions : done
- trusted OS Applications support : done
- counters support  : to be done
- connect GPT to counters : to be done

To be fixed :
- if TaskType is greater than 8 bits, we must use another LOAD or STORE instruction. Make a goil template to provide the correct instruction via a MACRO
